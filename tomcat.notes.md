1. APR use or not ?

    This version of tomcat will use http only, all https is done by proxy, no SSL.

2. APR is better than NIO ? 

    No. 
    
    "The APR provides certain performance benefits over BIO, 
    but no performance benefits over NIO, 
    and also *no* functionality benefits 
    - JIRA will function perfectly well without it."

    In https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/config/http.html:
    SSL Support - Connector - APR/Native (deprecated)

3. APR is the only connector with sendfile I/O ?
    
    No. All NIO could use sendfile

    Using sendfile breaks any use of zipping

    Mind that APR and SSL tomcat libraries are created for Windows servers.

4. Access Control ?

	If you wish to use Tomcat’s web administration tool, you will need to create an account for the administrator.

	Open /opt/apache-tomcat-a.b.c/conf/tomcat-users.xml in a text editor. Immediately after the line containing <tomcat-users>, insert:

		<role rolename="manager"/>
		<user username="tomcat" password="s3cret" roles="manager"/>

	Replace s3cret with your actual password.
